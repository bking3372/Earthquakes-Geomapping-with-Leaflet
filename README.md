Leaflet Challenge

Objective:  Build a set of tools to visualize earthquake data for the United States Geological Society

Step 1
Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the USGS data set based on the longitude and latitude.
•	Incorporate data markers to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes will appear larger and darker in color.
•	Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
•	Create a legend that will provide context for the map data.

Step2
Plot a second data set on the map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. 
•	Add a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out the two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.
•	Add layer controls to the map.
