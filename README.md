# Geomapping Earthquake Data with Leaflet

Objective:  Build a set of tools to visualize earthquake data for the United States Geological Society

Step 1:  Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the USGS data based on the longitude and latitude.
* Data markers are incorporated to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes will appear larger and darker in color.
* Popups are included to provide additional information for each earthquake.
* A legend is included to provide context for the map data.


Step 2:  Plot a second dataset on the map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. 
* Several base map options are provided as well as separate overlays for the earthquakes and faultlines that can be turned on and off independently.
